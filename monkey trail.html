                            <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                            <p>Monkey Trail is a short, 15-minute walk around the forested jungle headland. The track is mostly made up of bamboo boardwalk, wooden stairs, and a narrow sand-bagged pathway on the edge of the slope. The main attraction of this short hike is the opportunity to see many wild macaque monkeys who live on this trail. These monkeys are very common in South East Asia and are quite used to humans. Always open for everyone to enjoy this beautiful obstacle.</p>
